        <p>
            <span>Dave Miranda</span> is a devoted father to his two sons, 5 and 3 years old.
            Their favorite things to do together include Legos, building forts,
            indoor playgrounds, and children's museums. When he's not playing
            with his kids, Dave enjoys learning new things, self-improvement,
            winning his fantasy football league more often than not, and Wordle.
          </p>
          <p>
            A native Chicagoan and avid football watcher, Dave should be a Bears
            fan but they're just such a poorly-run franchise year in and year
            out, so he also roots for the Chiefs for two reasons: #1 He moved to
            the KC area in 2016, and #2 He cruised to a dominant fantasy
            football championship in 2018 after drafting the previously
            unheralded duo of Patrick Mahomes and Tyreek Hill.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prior to learning to code, Dave ran political campaigns for about a
            decade. In 2018 he started a consulting firm and managed six
            candidates and a staff of several dozen campaign workers. He has run
            campaigns with budgets ranging from $30,000 to $500,000. Before his
            political career, Dave worked in corporate public relations.

            Hello! I'm <span>Zac Wheeler</span>, a devoted husband and a proud father of two
            amazing kidsâ€”a lively 6-year-old and an adorable 2-year-old. As a
            family man, I find immense joy in spending quality time with my
            loved ones. Whether we're embarking on outdoor adventures, engaging

          <p>
            When I'm not wearing my dad hat, you'll likely find me indulging in
            two of my passions: movies and 3D printing. As a film enthusiast, I
            relish movie nights with a big bowl of popcorn in hand. From
            timeless classics to the latest blockbusters, count me in! On the
            creative front, I'm also an enthusiastic 3D printing aficionado.
            There's something uniquely satisfying about transforming digital
            designs into tangible objects, and I'm constantly tinkering with my
            printer, turning ideas into reality.
          </p>

          <p>
            Life is a delicate balance, and for me, that entails treasuring
            family moments, immersing myself in cinematic wonders, and diving
            into the world of 3D printing!
